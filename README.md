# MScThesis
Master's Thesis carried out at ETH Zurich, Switzerland. Thesis title: Switched Teleoperation-Autonomous Control for Human-Robot Cooperation using a Quadrupedal Mobile Manipulator. The thesis is divided in two main parts:
1. Human-Robot Cooperation for an object carrying transporation
2. Switches between teleoperation and autonomous mode

Regarding the Human-Robot Cooperation, in the folder "Videos" you can find the following videos:
- Human-Human Object Carrying: Experiment of object carrying task between two humans.
- Human-Robot Object Carrying: Experiment of object carrying task between a human and a robot.
- Human-Human Object Positioning: Experiment of object positioning task between two humans.
- Human-Robot Object Positioning: Experiment of object carrying task between a human and a robot.

Regarding the Switches between teleoperation and autonomous mode, in the folder "Videos" you can find the following videos:
- HardSwitchMaster and HardSwitchSlave: Experiment of switch from autonomous to teleoperation mode, where no smoothing actions and no delays are applied.
- SoftSwitchMaster and SoftSwitchSlave: Experiment of switch from autonomous to teleoperation mode, where smoothinng actions and delays are applied.

In the folder "Final Presentation" you can find the powerpoint presentation of my thesis. Unfortunately the code and the thesis cannot be published.
